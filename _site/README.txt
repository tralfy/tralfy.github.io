HOW TO USE

Every file that allows easy customization of the website has "user-" at the beginning of the name.

The title, description, page settings and links can be customized in the _data/user-config.yml file. There are comments in that file that describe how to change settings and add images and links.

Colors and fonts can be customized in the user-styles.css file. There are comments that will indicate how to change everything.

The favicon (which is shown when someone bookmarks the website) can be changed by replacing user-favicon.png with a square image of your choice. I recommend an image no larger than 512px square.
